Manual (hopefully temporary) adjustments to default EDGAR data.

1) EDGAR combustion NMVOC emissions for:

China (chn), 
Manufacturing Industries and Construction

jump by nearly a factor of 10 from 1980 to 1979. 

There is no evidence for this in the most recent IEA data. 

The more general solution will be to not scale combustion sectors for most countries before 1980 (where there are increasing issues with consistency between IEA data and EDGAR data).
